# Smart-Company-Management-System

## Overview
The **Smart Company Management System** is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance corporate security, communication, and operational efficiency through advanced networking and IoT-based monitoring. This system integrates firewalls, VPNs, VoIP, and smart sensors to create a secure and automated business environment, ensuring branch-to-headquarter connectivity while protecting sensitive data from cyber threats and environmental hazards.

## Objectives
- To increase security, communication, and operational efficiency through advanced networking and IoT-based monitoring.
- To integrate firewalls, VPNs, VoIP, and IoT sensors for a secure and automated business environment.
- To create a disaster management system with real-time monitoring and automated safety measures (e.g., fire sprinkler systems, sirens, and emergency exits).

## Key Features
1. **Firewall**:
   - Secure the network by filtering traffic using Access Control Lists (ACLs) and Network Address Translation (NAT).
   - Prevents unauthorized access while allowing legitimate communication.
   
2. **VoIP (Voice over IP)**:
   - Provides internal communication over the network using VoIP-enabled routers.
   - Efficient, secure, and cost-effective voice communication between branches.

3. **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**:
   - Ensures secure remote access to company resources with encrypted communication.
   - IPsec VPN tunnel mode provides secure data exchange between branch and HQ.

4. **IoT Sensors Integration**:
   - Security: Motion sensors, RFID access control, and CCTV systems to secure company premises.
   - Disaster Management: Fire and water level monitoring systems to automatically respond to hazardous conditions (e.g., sprinklers, sirens, emergency gates).
   - Power Management: Solar power generation, battery storage, and real-time energy consumption tracking.

## Implementation
1. **Firewall Configuration**:
   - Cisco ASA 5506-X firewall configured for traffic control, including ACLs and NAT rules.
   - Ensures that only valid outbound traffic is allowed while blocking external inbound connections.

2. **VPN & VoIP Setup**:
   - IPsec VPN tunnel ensures encrypted communication between branch and HQ.
   - VoIP system setup for internal communication with a numbering plan for both branch and HQ.

3. **IoT Sensor Integration**:
   - IoT sensors are deployed to monitor environmental conditions (temperature, fire, water levels).
   - RFID access control system enhances physical security by allowing entry only to authorized personnel.

4. **Power Management**:
   - Solar panel system for energy generation with smart monitoring and battery backup to ensure reliable power usage.

## Results
- **Security Enhancements**: Cisco ASA firewall and VPN provide a strong security framework for internal and external communication.
- **Efficient Communication**: The VoIP system enables cost-effective and encrypted communication between branches.
- **Automated Disaster Response**: Real-time monitoring of fire, temperature, and water levels with automated responses, including sprinklers, sirens, and unlocking emergency exits.
- **Optimized Energy Usage**: Solar panels, battery storage, and energy consumption tracking help in managing the company's energy needs efficiently.
